# Simulation and Modeling

Welcome to the Simulation and Modeling Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for lecture notes, lab exercise, and (coding) assignments related to the simulation and modeling subject.

## What to Expect:

- **Lecture Notes:** Stay updated with comprehensive lecture notes covering various topics in simulation and modeling. Whether you're exploring fundamental concepts or diving into advanced techniques, you'll find resources to enhance your understanding.

- **Lab Codes:** Dive into practical applications with our collection of lab codes. Explore hands-on examples, simulations, and experiments to reinforce theoretical concepts and gain practical experience.

- **Assignments:** Challenge yourself with assignments designed to test your understanding and problem-solving skills. Sharpen your modeling abilities and analytical thinking through a series of engaging assignments.

## Contribute:

I encourage contributions from students, educators, and professionals passionate about simulation and modeling. Whether you have lecture notes to share, lab codes to contribute, or assignments to propose, your contributions are valuable in enriching the learning experience for everyone.
